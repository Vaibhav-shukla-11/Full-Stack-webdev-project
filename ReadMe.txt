This is a project I worked on while learning web development. I used the help of a guided youtube video so this project has no signifance of me having any rights to it. It is just a project I did for my university. will be working on many more :)
This project helped me understand the concept of the structures of websites and how things actually are, while working on database management i fell in love with what goes behind the software thus increasing my interest in backend development. will be working on backend development, feel free to contact me for hackathons!
